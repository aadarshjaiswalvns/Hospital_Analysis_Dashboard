# 🏥 Hospital Data Analysis Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is an **interactive Hospital Data Analysis Dashboard** built using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard provides insights into patient data across multiple dimensions such as **age group, specialty, case type, city, and time period**.  

The analysis helps in understanding:  
- Patient distribution (Adult vs Child)  
- Case type trends (Inpatient, Outpatient, Day Case)  
- Specialty group performance  
- City-wise and age-wise patient counts  
- Yearly and monthly trends  

The project uses the provided **Excel dataset (`Hospital_Data.xlsb`)** as the source, with transformations and modeling done in Power BI.
